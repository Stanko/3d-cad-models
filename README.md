# My JSCAD parametric 3d models

I started learning to model using [JSCAD](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org). This repo will contain my models with direct links for editing and STL file download.

### Mounting bracket

Universal mounting bracket. I made these to mount power strip and monitor power supply under the desk.

Universal headphones hanger. Can be used for tables of shelves. Inspired by [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2775244).

### Water heater switch cover

This one won't be useful to anyone else I guess. Small cover to hide water heater switch so guests don't press it accidentally.
